🧠 How It Works
Uses Python's built-in socket module.

Loops through a range of ports and attempts to connect.

Prints out all open ports.

🛠️ Requirements
Just Python 😄
Make sure you're using Python 3.x

✨ Future Ideas
Add service/version detection

Export scan results to file

Add multi-threading for faster scanning

Integrate basic vulnerability checks
